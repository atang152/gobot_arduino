# LEARNING GOBOT WITH ARDUINO

I have always been interested with physical computing and robotics. Since I am currently learning Golang, I have decided to learn both at the same time to keep me motivated.

So instead of writing codes in C++ to interact with the Arduino Board. I decided to use GOBOT which is a framework/set of libraries for robotics written in Golang by Hybridgroup.

I went through some of the mini-tutorial in the "Arduino Projects Book" and wrote them using Golang instead.

The website for Gobot [https://gobot.io/documentation/getting-started/] and Github can be found here: [https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot].
